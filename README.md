once upon of time, there was a village that was haunted by a dragon. 
The dragon is worshipped by people and is treated like a God. Once a year, the dragon comes to the village and takes away two teenagers girls 
so, every year, the village has to sacrifice two teenager girls to the dragon, so he won't destroy the village and kills everybody 
Until one day a man appears in the village saying he will slay the dragon for them.
